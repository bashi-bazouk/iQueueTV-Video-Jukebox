    <h1>iQueue Video Jukebox</h1>
      <img id="jukebox" src="images/jukebox.png" />
      <p>The iQueue Video Jukebox is the most basic element and
      building block of the iQueueTV platform.  In it's current state
      of development, the Jukebox takes advantage of existing
      data-warehousing technology to stream music videos for
      uninterrupted, hands-free playback.</p>

      <p>As the Jukebox is subject to continuous improvement, future
      developments include Youtube integration, video recommendations,
      and improved playback and multiplexing.  Plans are also underway
      to deploy a proprietary video hosting solution.</p>

      <p>The Jukebox is served by a cloud-playlist system, responsible
      for the automatic procurement and managed organization of music
      videos directly from web logs and recommendation engines.  The
      Jukebox currently serves over 700 videos.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
    <h1>iQueue On Demand</h1>
      <img id="recommender1" src="images/recommender1.png" />
      <p>iQueue On Demand reworks the classic call-in voting system of
      Much On Demand and The Box within the browser to provide
      a semi-interactive video experience to the user, and an up-to-the-minute
      analytic and measurement system for analysts and brand
      managers.</p>

      <p>More importantly, iQueue On Demand serves as a training and
      testing-ground for future developments in recommendations
      systems and analytic tools.  Better recommender systems
      utilize the growing database of user input to develop complex
      heuristics and decision patterns.  </p>
      <img id="recommender2" src="images/recommender2.png" />

      <p>As our system grows and our database develops, iQueueTV
      consultants develop an ever-improving analysis of our audience
      likes and dislikes, taste, and culture.  This objective picture
      provides fundamental insights and advantages in the production
      of new video and targeted advertising, leading to better market
      penetration and higher return on investment.</p>

      <p>The iQueue On Demand system is currently under development by
      Josh Meyer and Max Garvey, and is set to release in the late Summer
      of 2012.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
    <h1>iQueue Mixtapes</h1>
      <p>iQueueTV leans toward the automatic in user experience.
      Products like the Jukebox and iQueue On Demand are designed with
      Set-It-And-Forget-It functionality, so users feel free to mingle
      their activities and find more time for the things they want and
      have to do.  iQueueTV in the background is considerably less
      intrusive than it's more configurable counterparts.</p>

      <p>Thinking along these lines, however, we've realized that there
      is a whole spectrum of applications that can trade automation
      for configurability.  We wondered how many clicks it takes to
      configure these applications.  We see that iQueue On Demand
      optimizes for automation while providing more configurability
      than the iQueue Video Jukebox.  How do other media applications
      fit into this pattern?  </p>

      <p>What we eventually realized is the startling complexity of
      modern playlist editors.  Youtube's playlist editor is
      cumbersome, and Vevo's offers little improvement and a dated
      interface.  Vimeo does not even offer a playlist editor, and
      their search algorithms are hopelessly inefficient.</p>

      <p>iQueue Mixtapes is the iQueueTV configurable playlist
      editor.  The project underway is to provide a fluid interface
      for making, saving, playing, sharing, and remaking video
      playlists.  iQueue Mixtapes will offer advanced search and
      indexing of music videos, so you can find exactly what you want
      with minimal research.  iQueue's web-application framework will
      provide advanced controls, letting you remix playlists
      interactively.  Finally, user profiles let you save your mixes
      for parties, promotional events, or just for hanging around.</p>

      <p>Brian has had an interest in music and the arts since
      childhood, recalling piano lessons, drum-kits, and an ongoing
      relationship with a rather broken electric guitar.  Tragically,
      he found his fate bent more toward the patter of keyboards and the
      curve of an ergonomic desk-chair.  Lately he has taken to making
      playlists and collecting music videos from various blogs and websites.</p>

      <p>Brian founded iQueueTV in 2011 to address his lifelong

    <h1>Television is Evolving</h1>
    <p>Network Ossification is a term used to describe the inability of
    existing media systems to adapt to market shifts and technologies.
    The term is made in reference to a biological process wherein pliable
    cells become bonelike, hard and brittle.</p>

    <p>Nowhere is ossification more evident then in the current state
    of broadcast television.  Progressive pricing schemes, in which
    consumers must pay exorbitant premiums for high quality content
    providers such as HBO and Starz, are the norm, and have remained
    relatively unchanged since the nineties.  Consumers often cite
    the rising cost of cable television as a chief indicator of
    inflation.  That is, they feel they are paying more each year for
    the same value of service.</p>

    <p>As unfortunate as the cable television provider's refusal to
    add new service and increase value to it's consumers is, broadcast
    television remains a multi-billion dollar industry.  In 2010,
    gross revenue generated from basic and premium cable television
    subscriptions exceeded 93 billion dollars, up from 89 billion in
    2009 (US Census Data).  The number of televisions per household
    increases yearly, as a majority of consumers continue to pay
    premium prices for television services.</p>

    <p>However, alternatives have emerged.  As internet networking
    technology matures, media companies are seeing bitrates sufficient
    for the transmission of high-quality digital video streams.
    Internet media companies, such as Netflix and Hulu that provide
    On-Demand video streaming, give users granular control of what
    they watch and when, for prices more than competitive with the
    traditional models.  Further, new hardware devices and set-top
    boxes allow consumers to view these internet streams via
    television, placing these companies in direct competition with
    their older broadcast counterparts.</p>

    <p>iQueueTV takes advantage of these trends in consumer behavior
    by developing new web-applications and delivery mediums for
    high-quality video content.  While focussing on the niche of music
    video consumption, our technological capability remains adaptable
    to the variety of new ideas which are shaping this revolution in
    television.</p>

    <img src="images/nielsen-streaming.png" />
    
    <h1>Technology is Emerging</h1>
    <p>With this radical shift in architecture, from circuit-switched
    cable-television to best-effort internet networks, comes a host of
    unforeseen technical problems.  Providers can no longer ensure
    broadcast quality via bandwidth reservations, but must instead
    utilize complex Content Distribution Networks to localize data
    around their audience.  Even with such complex CDN solutions as Akamai
    and Amazon Cloudfront, problems such as under-buffering, jitter,
    desynchronization, and transmission failure continue to frustrate
    users, who are only used to the nuanced failures of cable
    television (things such as network outages and radio static).</p> 

    <p>Technologists approach these new problems with a variety of
    solutions.  For instance, adaptive streaming is used in situations
    of low-bandwidth, wherein the server acknowledges by transmitting
    a lower-quality video at a reduced bitrate.  Technologies such as
    Real-Time Streaming Protocol allow Just-In-Time delivery of
    content in exchange for an optimally small bitrate.  As well, many
    optimizations are being investigated for mobile and wireless
    transmissions.</p>

    <p>Another problem with internet streaming is the lack of
    cross-platform standards.  Apple, Adobe, Google, and even recently
    Netflix, are currently engaged in an ongoing battle to define
    future HTML5 and MP4 standards, in an effort to gain market share
    for their industrial broadcast solutions.  Adobe has even recently
    entered an agreement with Amazon CloudFront, wherein their Media
    Server technology has been made the one and primary streaming
    solution for Amazon's CDN.

    <p>These problems demand a keen insight into Media Networking, and
    iQueueTV is poised to work at these frontiers.  Active
    programmatic developments in streaming clients, servers, and
    web-applications keep us up-to-date with new developments, and
    position us to branch out and quickly leverage new opportunities
    and technological advantages.

    <h1>Markets are Shifting</h1>
    <p>To consumer brands such as Nike, Converse, Levi's, and Coca Cola,
    the most valuable markets are consumers aged 18-34 with high
    levels of disposable income.  These are the people most likely to
    follow aspirational and consumptive buying patterns, and who drive
    a large part of sales revenue in these companies.</p>

    <p>As evidenced in the graphs above, this cluster is leading the
    shift from cable-television services to network-enabled streaming
    video.  Intuitively this makes sense, as affluent consumers are
    more likely to be early-adopters and tastemakers for the larger
    population.</p>

    <p>Research also shows that high-quality consumers and tastemakers
    are more likely to react negatively to banner advertising and tend
    to distrust mediums in which banner advertising is employed.
    Instead, such consumer clusters can be reached through "trusted"
    mediums, such as blogs and social networks.</p>

    <p>iQueueTV positions the Music Video as a third kind of trusted
    medium, one whose viral potential lies in consumer's realization
    of culture and fashion as defined by artists and videographers.
    iQueueTV promotes collaborative work between brands, producers,
    curators, and distributers, to increase market exposure through
    music videos.</p>
